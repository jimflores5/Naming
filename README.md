### Overview
 - In high school Chemistry, there are several basic (yet critical) skills that students must master.  These include taking quality measurements, performing metric conversions, dealing with significant figures/scientific notation, solving problems using dimensional analysis and writing chemical formulas.
 - Each of these skills gets better with practice, but how much practice a student needs varies from person to person.  Providing each student with just the right amount of practice AND timely feedback is challenging.
 - This project teaches students how to write a chemical formula when given the compoundâ€™s name and how to name a compound when given its formula.
 - Interactive tutorials introduce students to the new skills via dynamic notes, short video clips and guided practice problems. 
 - An "infinite practice" mode provides immediate feedback as students respond to randomly generated name and formula questions.
